# Image Histogram Equalization

This project demonstrates the implementation of histogram equalization for both grayscale and color images using Python, OpenCV, and Matplotlib. Histogram equalization is a technique used to improve the contrast in an image by redistributing the intensity values.

## Features

* Calculates the histogram for grayscale and color images (specifically the L channel in the LAB color space).
* Performs histogram equalization on both grayscale and color images.
* Visualizes the original and equalized images.
* Plots the histograms of the original and equalized images for comparison.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need to have the following libraries installed:

* OpenCV
* Matplotlib
* NumPy

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python-headless matplotlib numpy
